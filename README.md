# odin-recipes
This recipes project is part of The Odin Projects' foundation level course for HTML.
It had me create a home pages with a couple dishes as links and by clicking on them,
it would send the user to a new page that had the recipe of said dish, such as the 
ingredients and the steps to follow to cook it.

To accomplish this, I used the help of the website Allrecipes to provide the recipes
of the dishes chosen. Along with the dishes, Allrecipes provided the pictures used 
at the start of each recipe page.

I had to use the knowledge I gained from the course, from the command line to outright
writing in HTML to succeed in creating this small project. 

In the future, I would like to potentially add a video to the recipes just like 
Allrecipes has in their page as I believe it would be a great addition for people who
don't want to read but instead follow along with a video.
