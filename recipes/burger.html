    <h3>Description</h3>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>½ cup of bread crumbs</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon of salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon of pepper</li>

        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil grate.</li>
        <li>Whisk egg, salt, and pepper together in a medium bowl.</li>
        <li>Add ground beef and bread crumbs; mix with your hands or a fork until well 
            blended.</li>
        <li>Form into four 3/4-inch-thick patties.</li>
