        <li><strong>1</strong> whole onion <em>and</em> <strong>2 cloves</strong> of 
            garlic</li>
        <li><strong>1 can </strong>of crushed tomatoes <em>and</em><strong> 2 cans
            </strong>of tomato paste and sauce</li>
        <li><strong>2 tablespoons </strong>of sugar along with fresh parsley, dried
            basil leaves, salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and black pepper</li>
        <li><strong>Lasagna noodles</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Cheese: </strong>parmesan, mozzarella <em>and</em> ricotta</li>
        <li><strong>1 </strong>egg</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium 
            heat until well browned.</li>
        <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with 
            sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, 
            fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 ½ hours, stirring
            occasionally.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in 
            boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water.</li>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons 
            parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>To assemble, spread 1 ½ cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking 
            dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce, overlapping slightly. Spread 
            with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese 
            slices. Spoon 1 ½ cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup 
            Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with 
            foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the 
            foil does not touch the cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an 
            additional 25 minutes.</li>
        <li>Cool for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
